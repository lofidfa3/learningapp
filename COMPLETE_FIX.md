## 🚨 Critical Issue Found

**The main problem:** Stripe products might not be synced to Firestore!

When the Firebase Extension is installed, it needs to sync your Stripe products to Firestore.

---

## 🔧 Manual Fixes Needed

### Step 1: Sync Stripe Products to Firestore

**Option A: Automatic Sync (Recommended)**

1. Go to Firebase Console Extensions:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/linguanewes/extensions

2. Find "Run Payments with Stripe" extension

3. Click "Manage"

4. Click "Reconfigure"

5. Look for setting: "Products and pricing plans collection"
   - Should be set to: `products`

6. Make sure "Sync products" is enabled

7. Click "Save"

**Option B: Manual Sync via Stripe Dashboard**

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard:
   https://dashboard.stripe.com/products

2. Find your product with price: `price_1SHuT8KG36KCQ0Q54bupdoVU`

3. Make sure it's **ACTIVE** (not archived)

4. The Firebase Extension should auto-sync it within a few minutes

### Step 2: Verify Products in Firestore

1. Go to Firestore Console:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/linguanewes/firestore

2. Check if `products` collection exists

3. Inside products, check if there are documents

4. Each product should have a `prices` subcollection

5. Look for your price ID: `price_1SHuT8KG36KCQ0Q54bupdoVU`

**If products collection is empty:**
- The extension hasn't synced yet
- Wait 5 minutes, then check again
- Or reconfigure the extension (Step 1)

### Step 3: Update Vercel Environment Variable

The price ID in your code is updated, but you need to verify Vercel has the latest deployment:

```bash
# Pull latest environment variables
vercel env pull

# Verify .env file has correct values
cat .env.local

# Deploy again
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Test the Checkout Flow

1. **Open the app:**
   https://learningapp-7g5idqowu-amis-projects-6dcd4b7c.vercel.app/pricing

2. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)

3. **Click "Subscribe Now"**

4. **Watch Console for logs:**
   - Should see: Creating checkout session
   - Should see: Checkout URL received OR Session ID received
   - Should redirect to Stripe

5. **If nothing happens:**
   - Check Console for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests
   - Check Firestore for checkout_sessions document

## 📊 Expected Firestore Structure

After everything is working, you should see:

```
Firestore Root/
├── products/
│   └── {productId}/
│       ├── name: "..."
│       ├── active: true
│       └── prices/
│           └── price_1SHuT8KG36KCQ0Q54bupdoVU/
│               ├── active: true
│               ├── unit_amount: 100
│               ├── currency: "eur"
│               └── interval: "month"
│
└── customers/
    └── {userId}/
        ├── checkout_sessions/
        │   └── {sessionId}/
        │       ├── price: "price_1SHuT8KG36KCQ0Q54bupdoVU"
        │       ├── success_url: "..."
        │       ├── cancel_url: "..."
        │       └── url: "https://checkout.stripe.com/..." ← Extension adds this
        │
        └── subscriptions/
            └── {subscriptionId}/
                ├── status: "active"
                ├── current_period_end: {...}
                └── price: "price_1SHuT8KG36KCQ0Q54bupdoVU"
```

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostic

Run this in browser console when on /pricing page:

```javascript
// Check if Firebase is loaded
console.log('Firebase:', typeof firebase !== 'undefined' ? 'OK' : 'MISSING');

// Check if Firestore is accessible
firebase.firestore().collection('products').limit(1).get()
  .then(snap => console.log('Products exist:', !snap.empty))
  .catch(err => console.error('Firestore error:', err));

// Check if user is logged in
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  console.log('User:', user ? user.uid : 'Not logged in');
});
```
