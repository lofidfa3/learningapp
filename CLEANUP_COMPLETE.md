# ✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE - Firebase Stripe Extension Only

## 🎯 What I Did

I've completely cleaned up your codebase to use **ONLY the Firebase Stripe Extension** for payment processing.

## 🗑️ Deleted Files

### Custom Stripe API Routes (No longer needed)
- ❌ `app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
- ❌ `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- ❌ Entire `app/api/stripe/` directory

### Old Documentation (Replaced with clean guides)
- ❌ 20+ old markdown files with outdated instructions
- ❌ All Stripe custom implementation docs
- ❌ Old setup guides, fix guides, deployment guides

---

## ✅ What Remains (Clean & Essential)

### Core Documentation
- ✅ **README.md** - Updated with premium subscription info
- ✅ **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Complete Firebase Stripe Extension setup
- ✅ **AUTOMATED_SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Quick automated setup
- ✅ **STRIPE_EXTENSION_SETUP.md** - Extension-specific guide
- ✅ **FIRESTORE_RULES.md** - Security rules documentation

### Application Code
- ✅ **app/pricing/page.tsx** - Uses Firebase Stripe Extension (Firestore approach)
- ✅ **lib/auth-context.tsx** - Reads subscription from Firestore
- ✅ **lib/firebase.ts** - Firebase client configuration
- ✅ **firestore.rules** - Security rules (deployed)
- ✅ All other app code unchanged

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### Old Way (Custom Code - DELETED)
```
User → Your API Route → Stripe API → Response → User
          ↓
    Webhook handling
          ↓
    Update Firestore
```

### New Way (Firebase Extension - CLEAN)
```
User → Firestore write → Firebase Extension → Stripe → User
                              ↓
                         Auto webhook
                              ↓
                         Auto update Firestore
```
